=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Lab::Moose;

 my $instrument = instrument(
     type => 'random_instrument',
     connection_type => 'Socket',
     connection_options => {
         host => '132.199.11.2',
         port => 5025
     },
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This connection uses L<IO::Socket::INET> to interface with the operating
system's TCP stack. This works on most operating systems without installing any
additional software.

Without knowing the syntax of the used command-messages there is no way for the
connection to determine when C<Read> is finished. This is unlike GPIB, USBTMC,
or VXI-11 which have explicit End of Message indicators. To deal with this, the
C<read_length> parameter has the following semantics:

=over

=item C<Read> is given an explicit C<read_length> parameter

Keep calling sysread until C<read_length> bytes are read.

=item C<Read> is not given an explicit C<read_length> parameter

Do a single sysread with the connections default C<read_length>.

=back

For SCPI definite length blocks you will have to give the exact block length
with the C<read_length> parameter.

=head2 CONNECTION OPTIONS

=over

=item host

Host address.

=item port

Host port.

=item write_termchar

Append this to each write command. Default: C<"\n">.
