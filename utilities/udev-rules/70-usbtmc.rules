# give group 'daq' access to usbtmc devices
#
# NOTE: group "daq" should be defined in /etc/groups
#   otherwise can get bootup problems when usbtmc devices are connected
#   at boot.
#
# also there are files in the /dev/bus/usb/* structure that will need to
# have permissions adjusted, that the tmc_protfix script handles. There
# might be a more elegant way of doing this, but this does work on
# Fedora 31 and Centos8, and probably others, and is easier to edit
# to deal with kernel configuration changes.
